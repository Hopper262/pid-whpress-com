This directory holds binary data from each public release of Pathways into Darkness. This data is not distributed here for copyright reasons. Populate each folder with three files from the appropriate version:

* `app.rsrc` - resource fork of the "Pathways into Darkness" application
* `map.data` - data fork of the "Maps" file
* `shapes.rsrc` - resource fork of the "Shapes" file

These files should be raw dumps of the forks; do not use MacBinary or other encoding.

Once you have initialized the database from the `offline` directory (see documentation there), these binary files are no longer used and may be deleted.
